    <h2>Network user accounts</h2>
    <p>The students user accounts are stored on the central PiNet server. This means they can log in on any Raspberry Pi in the classroom and no more trying to figure out which SD card belongs to which student.</p>
  </div>
  <div class='span4'>
    <h2>Network booting</h2>
    <p> The Raspberry Pi operating system (Raspbian) is also stored on the central server, meaning each Raspberry Pi boots up off it each time. This allows you to maintain one perfect master operating system.</p>

    <h2>Shared folders & backups</h2>
    <p> Easy to setup shared folders to share resources with students and a breeze to set up automated backups for students work to an external drive.</p>
