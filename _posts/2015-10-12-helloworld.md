## Why a blog?

Over the past 2 years of development, many users have asked for a blog for PiNet so they can keep an eye on what is going on, without having to follow the Twitter feed. We have listened to those users and we now have a simple blog for PiNet!   
The Twitter account will still be the main place to hear about in realtime all the awesome new changes coming to PiNet, but the blog will serve to act as a more permanent log.  
## What type of content will be added to the blog?

The blog will also be mainly used to document most major stable PiNet releases including a full changelog. 
It will also though be used to document extra less known features in PiNet.
