Shared folders
-----------------------------

PiNet is able to set up shared folders with different permission levels for students and staff.   
Shared folders appear on the left hand bar in the Raspberry Pi file manager.   

##Permission levels
There are 2 built in permission levels currently for shared folders
1. **Pupil read only** - This means pupils can only read from the folder, they can't save files there or edit any of the files there unless they save a copy into their area.   
2. **Pupil read/write** - This means pupils can read from the folder but also edit and save new files into it. Be careful with this as anyone can edit anything!   
    
**Staff can read and write to any shared folder.**
