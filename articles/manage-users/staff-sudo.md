## Staff


PiNet supports two levels of user permissions.
- Pupil
- Staff

On the Raspberry Pis themselves there are very few differences between the two permission levels.   
On the server though is a different story.    
Staff have **full access** to PiNet control panel, Epoptes control panel and are **administrators** (sudo) on the server.   

Members of the staff group should keep their login credentials secure and use a strong password.   

### Adding a member of staff
1. Create the user as normal through the ```Create-user``` option in ```Manage-users```.
2. Select ```Add-staff``` from the ```Manage-users``` menu.
