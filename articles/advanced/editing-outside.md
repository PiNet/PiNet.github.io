Editing the operating system outside of PiNet
--------------------------------------------------

Although PiNet allows you to perform most actions a standard user
would need to the Raspbian operating system from within PiNet, it
is understandable if advanced users may want to directly modify
configuration files or install programs on the Raspbian operating system
manually.

The key things you need to know are

- The Raspbian operating system is stored at ```/opt/ltsp/armhf```

- To “chroot” into it (basically allows you to interact with it like a normal Raspberry Pi ```sudo ltsp-chroot --arch armhf``` 
  To exit when you are finished, just type exit and hit enter.

- The lts.conf file (LTSP armhf configuration file) is stored at ```/opt/ltsp/armhf/etc/lts.conf```

- To manually compress the operating system for use after a change ```ltsp-update-image /opt/ltsp/armhf``` 
**(this is extremely important you do this after a change!)**

- The raw boot files before configuration changes have been made can be found at [here](https://github.com/gbaman/PiNet/tree/master/boot)

##An example - Deleting Minecraft Pi edtion

Lets say you want to run a command in the Raspbian operating system, which is stored on the server (and each Pi boots from).   
For example, lets say you want to remove Minecraft-Pi edition (which is installed by default).   
To do this, open a terminal on the server and enter ```sudo ltsp-chroot --arch armhf``` (```sudo ltsp-chroot``` also works on its own if you have no other LTSP chroots).   
You are now inside the Raspbian OS which is running emulated on the server (via chroot). You can run nearly any command you could run on a Raspberry Pi here, 
including ```apt-get purge minecraft-pi``` which deletes Minecraft-Pi edition. When you have finished all your changes, enter ```exit``` and you will be returned to a normal server shell.  
Finally, **you must recompress the operating system!** You have 2 options on how to do this.   
1. From the commandline with ```ltsp-update-image /opt/ltsp/armhf```.
2. From PiNet in the ```Other menu``` and ```NBD-recompress```.
