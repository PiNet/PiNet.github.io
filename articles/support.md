#Support

Something isn't working, or perhaps you just have a general question about PiNet or want a hand adding it to your school?   
Is a few ways you can contact me.   

##Email
The simple one. I will try and reply within a week (although is usually more like an hour). If I don't reply within a week, email me again!

Email address is  *support at pi-ltsp dot net*

##IRC
If you want instant help, I sit on freenode IRC in the #ltsp channel quite a lot and you can drop me a private message.   
You can launch the freenode webchat site from [here](https://webchat.freenode.net/).   
Remember to enter the channel as #ltsp!

##Twitter
You can also drop a tweet to the project twitter account  [@RaspiLTSP](https://twitter.com/RaspiLTSP).
