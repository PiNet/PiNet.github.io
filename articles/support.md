# Support

**If your question is related to a PiNet issue (especially booting up your first Raspberry Pi with PiNet), have you tried the suggestions in the [troubleshooting section](troubleshooting/troubleshooting.html) of the site? Please make sure you have tried these first.**
   
   
Something isn't working, or perhaps you just have a general question about PiNet or want a hand adding it to your school?   
Is a few ways you can contact me.   

### Email
The simple one. I will try and reply within a week (although is usually more like an hour). If I don't reply within a week, email me again!   
Before emailing, please make sure you have tried all the troubleshooting documentation above as email support is right now provided as a free service and is done in my free time.   

Email address is  *support at pinet dot org dot uk*   
    
If it is a technical query, please include.
- PiNet version you are running   
- Which release channel are you using (stable, dev or custom)   
- Is PiNet installed on a dedicated machine or a virtual machine   
- Your position (student, teacher, technician, Pi enthusiast, etc)   
- Any weird customisations    
- School or organisation name (optional)   

### IRC
If you want instant help, I sit on freenode IRC in the #ltsp channel quite a lot and you can drop me a private message. Handle on there is gbaman.  
You can launch the freenode webchat site from [here](https://webchat.freenode.net/).   
Remember to enter the channel as #ltsp!   
I am not always on IRC though, so if I am there, drop me a message. If not, best bet not to bug the other busy developers on there and drop me an email or tweet instead.      

### Twitter
You can also drop a tweet to the project twitter account  [@PiNetDev](https://twitter.com/pinetdev).
