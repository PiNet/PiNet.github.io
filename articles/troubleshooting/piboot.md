# PiBoot folder issues    
If you are having issues with the automatically generated PiBoot folder created by PiNet, you can manually generate your PiBoot folder on your PiNet server or any other internet connected computer.   
1. Navigate to the PiNet boot files repository - [https://github.com/PiNet/PiNet-Boot](https://github.com/PiNet/PiNet-Boot)    
2. Click on the ```Download ZIP``` button to download the boot files.    
3. Unzip the downloaded zip and open the cmdline.txt file.   
4. Replace the ```1.1.1.1``` with your own servers IP address, this can be found at the top of the PiNet control panel. Then save the file.    
5. Flash these new [files onto an SD card](../installation/sd-card-copy.html).
